The overall attrition rate stands at 16%, with 237 employees having left the company out of a total workforce of 1,470. A closer look shows that younger employees, particularly those aged between 25 and 35, account for the majority of these exits. This suggests that early-career professionals may be leaving due to unmet expectations, lack of growth, or better external opportunities.

In terms of job roles, attrition is most common among Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists. These positions may involve higher pressure, lower satisfaction, or limited advancement paths.

Salary also plays a clear role. Most employees who left were earning less than ₹5,000 per month, indicating that compensation is a key factor driving attrition. On top of that, job satisfaction scores among those who left tend to be low, which reinforces the idea that dissatisfaction with the work environment or responsibilities is contributing to turnover.

Another important trend is the timing of departures. A significant number of employees leave within their first year, highlighting potential issues with onboarding, role clarity, or cultural fit. There’s also a noticeable spike around the ten-year mark, possibly pointing to stagnation or missed promotion opportunities over time.

When it comes to education fields, most attrition is seen among those with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical studies, which may reflect the company's workforce composition or specific challenges in those roles.

Overall, the data points to a combination of low satisfaction, limited career growth, heavy workload, and low pay as the main reasons behind employee attrition.
