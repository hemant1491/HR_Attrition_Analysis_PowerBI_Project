This analysis was developed in Power BI, using strong data modeling to integrate multiple HR attributes and custom DAX measures to calculate attrition rates, salary insights, and employee segmentation. The report covers 1,470 employees, with an overall attrition rate of 16%.

Key findings include:

Young professionals (ages 25–35) account for the majority of attrition, indicating early-career dissatisfaction or external opportunities.

Job roles with highest attrition include Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist—suggesting role-specific challenges or stress.

Employees who left typically earned less than ₹5,000/month, highlighting low compensation as a major factor.

Low job satisfaction (scores 1 and 2) is strongly associated with attrition, pointing to engagement or management issues.

A significant spike in attrition occurs in the first year of employment, suggesting onboarding or role clarity concerns.

Attrition is also influenced by workload factors, such as employees working overtime showing significantly higher turnover rates.

Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds contribute to the highest attrition, which could reflect either company workforce composition or domain-specific pressures.

The Power BI dashboard enables interactive filtering by job role, age, gender, and salary, providing HR teams with actionable insights to target retention strategies and improve employee engagement.
