This analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging data modeling techniques to organize employee information and applying DAX measures to calculate attrition rates, averages, and role-based insights. The dashboard reveals a 16% attrition rate, with the highest turnover among employees aged 25â€“35, especially in roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive. Most attrition occurs among low-income employees and those with low job satisfaction. Attrition peaks in the first year, suggesting onboarding or engagement challenges. Key factors include low compensation, limited growth, and role dissatisfaction.
